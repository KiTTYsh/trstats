# TRStats: TypeRacer Statistics Generator

## What is it?
A python-based tool that scrapes typeracer.com and gathers information on a user's races, and establishes further statistics using this data, outputting to a pleasant HTML file.

## How do I use it?
1. Install the dependencies with `pipenv install` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python -m stats [username]` to generate all possible stats for the given user.
3. Run `python -m stats --help` for more information on other options.

If you are using Windows, you will need to install, at least, [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/) and enable Environment Variables during installation.  Knowledge of how to use the command line will help as well.

## How can I help?
